# THE HARNESS FLOOR AND THE RECORD RATCHET (fuzz/coverage.sh, fuzz/records.sh). Reads one source of fuzz/, as the
# `llvm-cov show` of a harness prints it, `LINE|COUNT|source` (or any text as `LINE|0|source`), and prints one line for
# every abort() in it:
#
#   <file>:<guard line>:<abort line>:<count>:<records>:<the guard's first source line>
#
# The guard is the statement that decides whether the abort runs: the `if` it is the body of, or the statement it ends
# when it shares that line. <count> is how often the seed corpus executed the guard's first line; 0 is a property no
# seed tests. The abort's own count is not it: on a corpus that holds, no abort runs. Comments and string literals do
# not hold a site, so an abort() named in prose is not one.
#
# <records> is what the check's comment holds, read as OSS Verify's tools/check reads it (docs/build-contract.md, "The
# checks of a fuzz target"): the comment lines directly above the guard, those on the guard's lines and on the abort's.
# It is `records=<n>` for n pairs of lines
#
#   mutant: <path>:<line> `<old>` -> `<new>`
#   input: <seed>
#
# `not-a-property` for one line `not a property: <reason>`, and `NONE` for a check that has neither, or `BAD` when the
# lines are not that form: what the ratchet refuses. With -v records=1 it prints instead one line per record, its
# fields separated by tabs (or -v sep=<c>): <file> <abort line> <path> <line> <old> <new> <seed>.
