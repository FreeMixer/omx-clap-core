# make fuzz-records: EVERY CHECK NAMES THE BUG IT CATCHES, AND CATCHES IT. Each abort() of fuzz/ carries in its comment
# one or more records, a one-line change of the reader and the seed it shows on
#
#   mutant: <path>:<line> `<old>` -> `<new>`
#   input: <seed of the harness's corpus>
#
# or one line `not a property: <reason>` for a stop after an allocation of the harness's own fails (fuzz/checks.awk
# reads them as OSS Verify's tools/check does). A check with neither, or with lines not of that form, turns this red:
# the ratchet. Each record is then proved alone: the harness, plain and native with fuzz/standalone.c for its driver,
# exits 0 on the seed as the tree is; with the change made (`<old>` must occur once on that line) and the harness built
# again it exits 134 on the seed, and the abort() it reached is the record's own, which each abort() of the harness
# names on stderr in this build. So is each patch of fuzz/sabotage/, applied alone: the seed its header names aborts at
# the check it names. The source is restored before each run and on every exit path.
